### Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this Analysis was to see if it is financially feasible to start a bike sharing app in the city of Des Moines by creating visualizations of an already successful app in New York using their data. 

### Results
I found that this app would be a great fit in Des Moines since there are so many people that use the bikesharing program in New York. The only thing that would concern me is that New York is really condensed, so it is easier for the bikes to be in one spot for the busier times of the day, if Des Moines is more spread it, then it will have small heat maps scattered all over the place whereas NY had the start and ending locations in pretty much the same spot.

I used 7 visualizations but the one that stuck out to me the most was the user type data, in this img (https://github.com/909zamora/bikesharing/blob/main/Heatmap%20by%20user%20type.JPG), we can see that the subscribers are the ones that dominate our user market share and most of them happen to be male, if we could create an incentive to becomes a subscriber, it would not only boost our already successful subscriber base but it will also enable the female category to grow in a sustainable manner since subscribers are more likely to use the service. 


### Summary
Creating a similar app in Des Moines sounds like a great idea, but when looking at the big picture, we need to know that there is no other city like New York that is as populated, clustered & never sleeping. If Des Moines happens to be a quiet town where traffic is not an issue and commuting is primarily by vehicle, then it will be a slow take off. SO looking at the infrastructure of the city and the demand for new transportation will be something that needs to be considered as well.
