### Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this Analysis was to see if it is financially feasible to start a bike sharing app in the city of Des Moines by creating visualizations of an already successful app in New York using their data. 

### Results
I found that this app would be a great fit in Des Moines since there are so many people that use the bikesharing program in New York. The only thing that would concern me is that New York is really condensed, so it is easier for the bikes to be in one spot for the busier times of the day, if Des Moines is more spread it, then it will have small heat maps scattered all over the place whereas NY had the start and ending locations in pretty much the same spot. 



### Summary
